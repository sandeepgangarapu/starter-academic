I am a fifth-year Doctoral Candidate studying Information and Decision Sciences at Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. I am from [Kalyanadurgam](https://goo.gl/maps/CJgEUE9FbMT2), a town in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, India.

I develop methods and frameworks that help decision-makers (Marketers, Clinicians, or Policy-makers) better conduct Randomized Controlled Trials (A/B testing) and also optimally target subjects and treatments in a budget-constrained, heterogeneous treatment effect environment. These questions fall in the line of literature related to Heterogeneous Treatment effects and Multi-Armed Bandits. I use a mix of Statistics, Machine Learning, and Causal Inference to solve the above problems.

Before moving to Minneapolis, I worked at Google as an Automation Specialist in the Google Search Anti-Abuse team developing scalable solutions to fight abuse on Google Search. Before that, I completed Masters’ and Bachelors’ in Aerospace Engineering with a specialization in Computational Fluid Dynamics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

While I am not doing research or grading assignments, I am either running or riding my [onewheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNqOU4jx62I).
